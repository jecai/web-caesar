# web-caesar
In this assignment you'll implement a web-based version of the Caesar cipher.
Submitting the form with a rotation integer and message results in the encrypted text being displayed. For example, rotating "The crow flies at midnight!" by 13 gives "Gur pebj syvrf ng zvqavtug!".
Rotation preserves spaces and punctuation.
Successively rotating by complementary amounts--e.g. 13 and 13, 10 and 16, 4 and 22, etc.--gives the same message that you started with.
